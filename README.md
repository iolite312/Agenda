# Agenda

Agenda is just like it says a agenda application.

## Running the application

Before starting the application copy the `.env.example` file and name it `.env` and change the passwords of the database accounts if you want

```sh
docker compose up -d
```
and when the application has started you may have to reboot the whole application because ratchet has crashed

## accessing the application

Agenda comes with two default accounts that have some agenda's already added to them

Main account:

```
email: admin@admin.com
password: 1234
```

Secondary account:

```
email: guest@guest.com
password: 1234
